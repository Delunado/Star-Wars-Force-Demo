# Star-Wars-Force-Demo
A little Star Wars Force Powers Demo using Unity.

Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP9XZZ9vUtA 

This is a demo made using Unity, where you can try some Star Wars Force Powers as pushing objects with force fields or grabbing and launching them from the distance. It is not a game because you can really do anything in the world but trying the powers.

You can play it using keyboard or controller. The instructions are inside the demo, and you can see them pressing Escape or Controller Back.
